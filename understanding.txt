1. What does getCell(int row, int col) return if you pass invalid coordinates like (-1, 5)?

The function checks whether the row and column are inside the board (0 ≤ row < 3 and 0 ≤ col < 3).
If the coordinates are invalid it returns the space character ' ' (the same value used for empty cells).

2. What does getWinner() return when there's no winner yet?

It returns a single space character ' ' to indicate that no player has won.

3. Explain why getWinner() is marked const but makeMove() is not.

getWinner() only reads the board and does not modify any member variables, so it is declared const.
makeMove() changes the board, the current player, and the move count, therefore it cannot be const.

4. If the board is full but nobody has won, what should isGameOver() return?

It should return true because the game is over (a tie).

5. What value does getCurrentPlayer() return at the start of a new game?

It returns 'X' – the first player always starts.
